                <h1>Hi, I'm Lennox</h1>
                <p>I'm a full stack developer who just recently completed the Codeup Web Dev program. I truly appreciate coding with a cheerful and upbeat perspective, especially in the area of front-end programming. Because of my attention to detail and passion for delving into the nuances of programming, I find great satisfaction in debugging and problem-solving. Additionally, I can efficiently oversee and coordinate the execution of projects thanks to my project management skills.</p>
                <p>My favorite languages are Java and JavaScript, but I'm always looking to learn more. I'm currently
                    learning AWS and React, and I'm excited to see where they take me.</p>
